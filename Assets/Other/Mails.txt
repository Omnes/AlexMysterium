From: Yue

Hi dear, I'm going to be late today. 
Sorry. Could you give Alex a ride to her football practice? 
I don't want her to take the buss all alone. 
Don't forget to pack her water bottle, she always forgets it. 
And her shin guards. And please pack a sweater, 
she says she doesn't need one because it's summer but it's 
going to be cold tonight. Also, makes sure she eats something 
before the practice. 

Love you, 
Yue
